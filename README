TJBuilder
---------

This is a small utility jar to help bootstrap the build processes of
other [presumably Java-based] projects.

Assuming 'tjb' is aliased to 'java -jar TJBuilder.jar':

	tjb touch -latest-within <dir> <dir>

will update <dir>'s latest-modification timestamp to that of the most
recent modification of all files and directoy contained within <dir>.

You can use this for great effect within Makefiles:

	touch = java -jar TJBuilder-bootstrap.jar touch
	
	.PHONY: .FORCE
	
	src: .FORCE
		${touch} -latest-within "$@" "$@"

	bin: src
		..steps to compile from src to bin..
		${touch} "$@"

This will ensure that bin is recompiled whenever any file or directory
within src is modified.  TJBuilder's own Makefile is an example of
such usage.
